FutureEats is an imaginary mobile site that reproduces food ordering services similar to UberEats.


## The App
![futureEats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60905493/90396399-8757f600-e06c-11ea-823c-a005753dc1d7.gif)

The API was provided by Labenu.

We develop the entire front-end concerned with best code practices to fit use of react-redux and connected-router tools/libs. In order to do that, the source folder was divided in actions, components, containers, reducers and support folders (icons, imgs and style).
